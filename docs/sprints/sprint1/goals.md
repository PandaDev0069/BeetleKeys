# 🎯 Goals - Sprint [1]

## Must-Have

1. Confirm the techstack
    - [ ] Research and finalize the tech stack for the typing engine
    - [ ] Document the tech stack decisions and rationale
    - [ ] Set up initial project structure with chosen technologies

2. Create a basic typing engine prototype
    - [ ] Implement core typing functionality (input handling, basic text display)
    - [ ] Ensure the prototype can run in a simple environment (e.g., command line)
    - [ ] Write initial tests to validate core functionality

## Stretch

- Add a simple gui for typing engine
  
## Success Criteria

- Tech stack should be documented and easy to use and learn.
- Prototype should demonstrate basic typing functionality without major bugs.
